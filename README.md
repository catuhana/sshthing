Mass-generate Ed25519 SSH keys until a word is found in its fields (private/public key, fingerprints, etc.).

## *Benchmark*

On average, generates

- 280_000 keys on an Intel i5-1240p
- 490_000 keys on a AMD Ryzen 5 7600
- ~~200_000 keys on an Apple Silicon M1 Max~~ (outdated, pending to update)
- ~~560_000 keys on an Apple Silicon M4 Max~~ (outdated, pending to update)

per second.
